    <h2 id="TRAText">TRAVIS HEAD</h2>
    <h4 id="TRAText">BATTER</h4>
    <p>Travis Head, the Australian cricketer, has had an interesting journey in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Let‚Äôs take a closer look at his IPL career:

        IPL Debut: Travis Head made his IPL debut in 2016 with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), who bought him for INR 50 Lakhs. Despite not being part of the T20 World Cup squad for Australia that year, RCB showed interest in the talented left-hander1.
        Performance: In 23 IPL matches, Travis Head has scored a total of 738 runs at an average of 38.84. He has also slammed one century and five half-centuries, with his highest IPL score being 102 runs. During his IPL career, he has hit 73 fours and 39 sixes2.
        Teams: Apart from RCB, Travis Head has also played for the Delhi Capitals (DC) in the past. However, he has yet to make a significant impact in the IPL, with a relatively modest average of 17.76 and a strike rate of 117.82 in 19 matches3.

    <h4 id="ABHIText">All-Rounder</h4>
    <p>IPL Debut: Abhishek Sharma made his IPL debut in 2018 with the Delhi Daredevils (now known as Delhi Capitals). Interestingly, he was signed by the Daredevils as a 17-year-old, just a week before India‚Äôs Under-19 squad, of which he was a part, won the World Cup in New Zealand1.
        Impressive Debut: On his IPL debut against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Abhishek made quite an impact. He blitzed 46 off just 19 balls, showcasing his aggressive batting style. However, despite this impressive start, he spent only one season with Delhi before moving to the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2019, where he has remained ever since1.
        Fastest IPL Fifty: In the 2024 IPL season, Abhishek Sharma etched his name in the record books. He smashed the fastest IPL fifty for SRH, taking just 16 balls to reach the milestone. This remarkable feat occurred during a match where SRH amassed the highest total in IPL history‚Äî277 runs‚Äîagainst the Mumbai Indians1.
        All-Rounder: Abhishek is not only a clean striker of the ball but also a handy left-arm spinner. His solid game against both pace and spin has made him a valuable asset for SRH.

His backspinning legcutters can surprise batters, adding another dimension to his game1.

        Record-Breaking Performances: Abhishek‚Äôs performances haven‚Äôt been limited to T20s. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 trophy, he scored 485 runs for Punjab, including two hundreds and three half-centuries, while striking at over 180. His 112 off 51 balls against Andhra Pradesh powered Punjab to a tournament-record total of 275 for 6. Notably, he also smashed 63 off 23 balls in the 2024 IPL, helping SRH set a new IPL record total of 277 for 31.
        First-Class Cricket: Abhishek isn‚Äôt just a limited-overs prospect. He made his Ranji Trophy debut in 2017, scoring 94 from No. 8. In December 2022, he achieved his first first-class hundred in a draw against Chandigarh1.</p>
